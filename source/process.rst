Open Standard
=============

OpenSMARTS is an open standard which welcomes contributions from the community.
There is no membership requirements and fees associated with contributing. All
communication is done publicly on *the mailing list*. Private communications
between a selected group may be used but at the very least, the results and the
arguments should be made publicly if this is to lead to a modification of the
Standard.

Versioning
----------

The OpenSMARTS specification's versioning uses a major and minor version
number. Incrementing the major version number allows for changes to the
standard that make the syntax more strict or change semantics. This should
not happen too often to ensure implementations that aim to be compliant
do not have to be changed every few moths. Although there is no formal
voting or approval process, changes only happen after discussion within
the community and interested parties.

Any change to the actual specification (sections `grammar`, `reading`
and `writing` increment the minor version number. Changes to other sections
may be made without changing the version. All maintainer may apply these
changes without consulting the other maintainers if they feel confident
that the changes are valid and do not break the specification. In case
of doubt, the mailing list should be used to verify the changes.
