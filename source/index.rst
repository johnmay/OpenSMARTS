   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

OpenSMARTS specification (draft Spetember 1012)
===============================================

The OpenSMARTS specifiaction is an extension of the
`OpenSMILES <http://www.opensmiles.org>`_ specification. The grammar section
from the OpenSMARTS section stands on it's own and does not require the grammar
section of the OpenSMILES specification. The semantics sections (reading and
writing SMARTS) do require the OpenSMILES specification and will reference it
frequently.
